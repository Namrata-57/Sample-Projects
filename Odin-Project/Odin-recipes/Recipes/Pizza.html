    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a double-rise dough typical of Neapolitan pizza. Two different
      rise methods are provided, one overnight in refrigerator and the other
      with a sponge.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Stir in 2 cups of flour and
        salt; mix well. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating
        well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it
        out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple,
        about 15 minutes. Place dough in bowl dusted with flour cover with
        plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

        In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup water. Stir in 1/2 cup of
        flour; mix well. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise until foamy,
        about 1 hour. Blend in remaining water, flour and salt; beat well. When
        the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured
        surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 15 minutes. Place dough
        in bowl dusted with flour and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until
        doubled, about 2 to 3 hours.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide
        the dough into two equal pieces. Roll dough out to half of its final
        size. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes (while you prepare desired pizza
        toppings). Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Stretch out dough over your floured knuckles and spin/toss 2 to 3 times
        until desired size is achieved. Place dough on a baker's peel sprinkled
        with cornmeal or a lightly greased pizza pan. Spread with desired
        toppings and bake on a pizza stone in preheated oven for 8 to 10
        minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes
        before serving.
